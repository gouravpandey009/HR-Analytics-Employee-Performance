## 🗄️ **SQL Queries**
A series of **SQL queries** were executed to delve into various facets of the dataset:

1. **Average Age by Department and Gender**: Calculated using SQL's `AVG()` function, providing demographic insights.
2. **Top Departments by Average Training Scores**: Identified top 3 departments with the highest training scores using `AVG()` and the `TOP` clause.
3. **Percentage of Employees with Awards by Region**: Calculated using `COUNT()` to highlight regional recognition.
4. **Count of Employees with KPIs > 80% by Recruitment Channel and Education Level**: Leveraged `COUNT()` for categorization.
5. **Average Length of Service by Department with Previous Year Rating >= 4**: Used `AVG()` and conditional filtering.
6. **Top Regions by Average Previous Year Ratings**: Revealed top 5 regions using `AVG()` and the `TOP` clause.
7. **Departments with More than 100 Employees and Length of Service > 5 years**: Identified using `COUNT()` and filtering.
8. **Average Length of Service for Employees with More than 3 Trainings**: Computed via `AVG()` and grouping.
9. **Percentage of Female Employees with Awards by Department**: Employed `COUNT()` for percentage calculation.
10. **Percentage of Employees with Length of Service between 5 and 10 years**: Determined using `COUNT()` and percentage calculation.
11. **Top Regions by Employees with KPIs > 80% and Awards**: Unveiled top 3 regions with the highest numbers using `TOP`, `COUNT()`, and grouping.
12. **Average Length of Service by Education Level and Gender**: Computed for employees meeting training and score criteria using `AVG()` and grouping.

Each query was meticulously crafted to answer specific analytical questions, aggregating data and calculating summary statistics. 📈
